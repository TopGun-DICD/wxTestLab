# wxTestLab

The wxTestLab project aims to automatically detect correct and incorrect answers in tests written in A4 format paper.
It is something like ZipGrade project but for PC.

In this project I use the next set of libraries:
- [**wxWidgets**](http://wxwidgets.org/downloads/) library to implement GUI (currently version wxWidgets-3.0.4 is used);
- [**OpenCV**](https://opencv.org/releases/) library for image manupulations (library version 3.4.7 is used).

At this moment my program is able to detect markers on a list fitted to the given areas.
